# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
I think that I have improved my understanding of methods and their function.   

1. What do you need to improve?
syntax, file organization, interpreting error messages, understanding/linking arguments from method to method.

1. What questions do you still have?
how to properly link arguments to methods?
how to approach error messages?

# Rubric

## Functionality

Notes:  My test provides error messages, but my program produces the expected return

- [X] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 2

Notes: I need to work on hashes and connecting methods, arguments within a class.  

The student(s):

- [ ] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [ ] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [ ] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design - 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [X] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [X] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 2

Notes: My test provides error messages, but my program produces the expected return

The student(s):

- [X] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [X] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control - 1

Notes: Github is still foggy to me.  

The student(s):

- [X] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
